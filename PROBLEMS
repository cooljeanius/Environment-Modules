GENERAL
------

If you define a module for Tcl and incorrectly define TCL_LIBRARY
then "module whatis" will likely fail with an error message
of this form:
	tcltk(51):ERROR:159: Cannot initialize TCL
when it tries to initialize an interpretor for the next entry.
This will happen if your Tcl was built such that it requires
this environment variable to find the initializing Tcl scripts.
It may also fail if the Tcl version is incompatible.

SOLARIS
-------

IF you really want a static binary, you will have to make sure to
link everything EXCEPT `-ldl' static. This you control with the
option -Bstatic and -Bdynamic. GCC doesn't support this, so you
must call the `ld' directly...

Also, if you have X11 support, and want a static binary in OW3.3,
you must add these libraries as well:

	-lsocket -lnsl -lw -lintl

GCC
---

If the TCL library is compiled with `gcc', you might have trouble if you
compile Modules with another compiler. If you get a warning about missing
"___main", try adding the gcc library, e.g -lgcc or use a sequence like
`gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`.

LINUX
-----
If the modulefile does not end with a blank line then the modulecmd
will spew out error messages, but yet successfully intepret the
modulefile.

REDHAT 7.2
----------
If you have dejagnu installed to run the testsuite
and it complains about not finding config.guess, do the following:
	cd /usr/share/dejagnu; ln -s ../automake/config.guess .
